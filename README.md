Agreed upon processes for repo / group (branching/merging, directories, work hours/communication/response times)
- Do testing before pushing into main
- 1-3 pm work hours
- Communication Methods (phones) with 24 hour response times
- Possible Directories: Test code directory, main directory
- Can find progress reports in the "Reports" folder
- Regular Signals file to set all to high then low
- NonWorkingTests folder for works in progress and experimentation that isn't quite there yet
- Experiments with their own named folders (like pulse experiment) that have been completed/doing well in progress
