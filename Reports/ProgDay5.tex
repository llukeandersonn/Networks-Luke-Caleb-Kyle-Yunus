%% Section enumerating upcoming tasks and task owners for roughly the next 24 hours
\section*{Next Goals and Deliverables}
\begin{itemize}
\item Fix receiver decoding - CLYK

\item Compile code for two-way transmission and reception - CLYK

\item Fix and properly implement Manchester Encoding - CLYK

\end{itemize}
%% Section enumerating progress from the previous day. Items people were responsible for in the last progress report must appear. Additional tasks that the group agreed to add since the last progress report may be presented here. 
\section*{Previous Goals and Deliverables}
\begin{itemize}
\item Prompt user using stdin to change the message transmitted - Luke (DONE)
\item Send characters more complex than a single bit - Yunus, Luke (in progress)
\item Separately implement an error detection to go along with the Manchester encoding (parity bit) - CLYK (deferred)
\item Continue looking into usage and functions of UART to determine if its worth utilizing - CLYK (DONE)
\item Research waves and pulses to use in conjunction with bb\_serial\_read() - CLYK (in progress)
\item Submit Progress Update - (DONE) (Reports/ProgDay5.tex)
\end{itemize}
%% Sections above should be short bullets. Longer free form discussion of information from above goes here. These should still be short! More that a couple sentences and the discussion is better suited as a results write-up, appendix, or design document.
\section*{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
\item Prompt user using stdin to change the message transmitted - The program now prompts the user for up to 64 characters they'd like to transmit.
\item Send characters more complex than a single bit - We successfully transmitted bytes, even if they're not properly recognized yet.
\item Separately implement an error detection to go along with the Manchester encoding (parity bit) - Despite successfully getting Manchester encoding up and running, we haven't yet implemented a parity bit successfully, as we're still having issues with message contents.
\item Continue looking into usage and functions of UART to determine if its worth utilizing - Due to the configuration of the NIC, we decided to choose Manchester encoding. We have an implementation of this encoding right now but are oddly receiving a fixed set of bytes regardless of the message transmitted, leading us to investigate our decoding sequence.
\item Research waves and pulses to use in conjunction with bb\_serial\_read() - We've discovered how to create pulses simply using gpio\_write() and time\_sleep(), but haven't yet found a productive use of bb\_serial\_read() in our implementation.

\end{itemize}
